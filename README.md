# Rock Paper Scissor Image Classification Using Model Deployment
## This project aims to classify hand movements with similarities to Rock Paper Scissor movements using TensorFlow and deployment models.
**Project Criteria**
* The dataset to be used is free, but has at least 1000 images.
* The dataset has never been used in a machine learning class submission before.
* The dataset is divided into 80% train set and 20% test set.
* The model must use a sequential model.
* The model must use Conv2D Maxpooling Layer.
* The accuracy of the training and validation set is at least 80%.
* Using Callbacks.
* Make a plot against the accuracy and loss of the model.
* Write code to save the model into TF-Lite format.
